# Title

# Abstract

Letâ€™s face it, groceries shopping is not a skill most of us intentionally took the time to pursue. However, people more than often find themselves in a situation where they return home with two bags of groceries and realize that they are missing the only item they were out for. Sometimes, not having a clear idea about our inventory state, we end up being tempted into all sorts of treats that are over and above our necessities. Or we buy products to showcase our cooking abilities for the family dinner only to end up shoving everything into the fridge hoping to come back for cooking tomorrow. We are often surprised by the amount of items we throw because the expiration date passed two months ago! But that can change...

The purpose of this project is to search for trends in transactions, discover anomalies, find relationships between items and delicious recipes, discover the intentions behind the transactions, classify the households to get better understanding of their values, and gain insights on whether or not people take groceries shopping for granted. Having this information in our hands we can draw conclusions and propose effective methods for people to make their next visit to the market an enjoyable experience.

The core dataset for our project is the Dunnhumby dataset. It has (almost) everything we need to tackle our research questions and find out the most reasonable answers.
